# In28Minutes.Library

This project is a library management system that demonstrates the use of modern .NET Core web API development practices. It is designed as part of a learning exercise and serves as a practical example of implementing a clean architecture with essential features such as user authentication, book management, category management, and more.

---

## Features

###   Core Functionalities  
-   User Authentication  :
  - Secure login and registration endpoints through the `AuthController`.
-   Book Management  :
  - CRUD operations for books via the `BooksController`.
-   Category Management  :
  - Manage categories associated with books through the `CategoriesController`.
-   User Management  :
  - Administrative functions for managing users through the `UsersController`.

###   Middleware  
-   Exception Handling Middleware  :
  - Provides centralized error logging using Serilog and ensures meaningful error responses.

###   Database Management  
-   Entity Framework Core  :
  - `ApplicationDbContext` for database interaction.
  - Migrations are managed for schema changes.
-   Seed Data  :
  - Preloads the database with necessary data using `SeedDataExtension`.

###   Repository Pattern  
- Follows the repository pattern for abstracting data access:
  - `BookRepository`, `CategoryRepository`, and `UserService` handle core database operations.
  - `UnitOfWork` ensures transactional integrity.

###   Automated Mapping  
-   AutoMapper  :
  - Simplifies object-to-object mapping for DTOs and entities with mapping profiles defined in `Mappings/Mapping.cs`.

## Project Structure

###   Controllers  
-   `BooksController`  : Handles all API endpoints related to books.
-   `CategoriesController`  : Manages categories for books.
-   `UsersController`  : Administrative endpoints for managing users.
-   `AuthController`  : Manages authentication and authorization.

###   Data  
-   `ApplicationDbContext`  : Manages EF Core database connections.
-   Seed Data  : Extension for populating initial data.

###   Middlewares  
-   `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware`  : Logs errors and provides a centralized exception handling mechanism.

###   Models  
-   `Book`  : Represents book entities.
-   `Category`  : Represents book categories.
-   `User`  : Represents user data with authentication roles.

###   Repositories  
-   Interfaces  : Define contracts for all repository operations.
  - `IBookRepository`, `ICategoryRepository`, and `IUserService`.
-   Implementations  : Concrete classes handling database operations.
  - `BookRepository`, `CategoryRepository`.

## Technology Stack

-   .NET Core 8  : Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
-   Entity Framework Core  : Object-relational mapping (ORM) for database operations.
-   AutoMapper  : Library for object-to-object mapping.
-   SQL Server  : Backend database for data storage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1.   Install .NET 8 or 9 SDK  .
2.   SQL Server  : Ensure you have access to an SQL Server instance.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:


2. Configure your database connection in `appsettings.json`:


3. Apply migrations and seed data:


4. Run the project:


5. Use a tool like Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

###   Authentication  
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in with existing credentials.
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.

###   Books  
- `GET /api/books`: Retrieve all books (Admin only).
- `GET /api/books/{id}`: Retrieve a specific book by ID.
- `POST /api/books`: Create a new book (Admin only).
- `PUT /api/books/{id}`: Update an existing book (Admin only).
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}`: Delete a book (Admin only).

###   Categories  
- `GET /api/categories`: Retrieve all categories.
- `POST /api/categories`: Add a new category (Admin only).
